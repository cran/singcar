The use of this t test is illustrated with examples and its results compared to those from the standard procedure. It is suggested that the t test be used when the N of the normative sample is less than 50. Finally, a computer program that implements the modiﬁed t-test procedure is described.

The effects of departures from normality were examined, as was the effect of varying degrees of measurement error in the scores of controls and the single case. Measurement error produced a moderate reduction in power when present in both controls and the case; the effect of differentially greater measurement error for the single case depended on the initial level of power. When Mycroft et al.'s method was used to test for the presence of a classical dissociation, it produced very high Type I error rates (ranging from 20.7\% to 49.3\%); in contrast, the rates for criteria proposed by Crawford and Garthwaite (2005b) were low (ranging from 1.3\% to 6.7\%).

When used as signiﬁcance tests, the two remaining methods (Crawford and Howell’s method and a prediction interval method ﬁrst used by Barton and colleagues) are also equivalent and achieve control of the Type I error rate (the two methods do differ however in other important aspects).

(3) In all but the most unusual of circumstances Crawford and Howell’s method can also safely be used to test whether the mean of a notional patient population is lower than that of a control population, should neuropsychologists wish to construe the test in this way. (4) In contrast, the method proposed by Corballis is not legitimate for either of these purposes because it fails to allow for uncertainty over the control mean (as a result Type I errors will not be under control).

Extending earlier work by Sokal and Rohlf (1995) and Crawford and Howell (in press), we developed a modiﬁed paired samples t test as an alternative to this formula. Unlike the Payne and Jones formula, the new method treats data from a normative or control sample as sample statistics rather than as population parameters. Technically, the new method is more appropriate for any comparison of an individual’s difference score against normative data. However, it is most useful when the normative data is derived from samples with modest Ns; in these circumstances the Payne and Jones method overestimates the abnormality of differences. We suggest that the modiﬁed t test can be a useful tool in clinical practice and in single-case research.

The most famous of these illusions is the ‘size–weight illusion’, where a small object feels heavier than an identically weighted, but otherwise similar-looking, larger object. There are, however, a variety of similar illusions which can be induced by varying other stimulus properties, such as surface material, temperature, colour, and even shape. Despite well over 100 years of research, there is little consensus about the mechanisms underpinning these illusions. In this review, I will first provide an overview of the weight illusions that have been described. I will then outline the dominant theories that have emerged over the past decade for why we consistently misperceive the weights of objects which vary in size, with a particular focus on the role of lifters’ expectations of heaviness. Finally, I will discuss the magnitude of the various weight illusions and suggest how this largely overlooked facet of the topic might resolve some of the debates surrounding the cause of these misperceptions of heaviness.},

	abstract = {The size-weight illusion is a perceptual illusion where smaller objects are judged as heavier than equally weighted larger objects. A previous informal report suggests that visual form agnosic patient DF does not experience the size-weight illusion when vision is the only available cue to object size. We tested this experimentally, comparing the magnitudes of DF’s visual, kinesthetic and visual-kinesthetic size-weight illusions to those of 28 similarly-aged controls. A modified t-test found that DF’s visual size-weight illusion was significantly smaller than that of controls (zcc = −1.7). A test of simple dissociation based on the Revised Standardized Difference Test found that the discrepancy between the magnitude of DF’s visual and kinesthetic size-weight illusions was not significantly different from that of controls (zdcc = −1.054), thereby failing to establish a dissociation between the visual and kinesthetic conditions. These results are consistent with previous suggestions that visual form agnosia, following ventral visual stream damage, is associated with an abnormally reduced size-weight illusion. The results, however, do not confirm that this reduction is specific to the use of visual size cues to predict object weight, rather than reflecting more general changes in the processing of object size cues or in the use of predictive strategies for lifting.},

	abstract = {Researchers and clinicians in neuropsychology often compare individual patients against healthy control samples, to quantify evidence for cognitive-behavioural deﬁcits and dissociations. Statistical methods for these comparisons have been developed that control Type I (false positive) errors effectively. However, remarkably little attention has been given to the power of these tests. In this practical primer, we describe, in minimally technical terms, the origins and limits of power for caseecontrol comparisons. We argue that power calculations can play useful roles in single-case study design and interpretation, and we make suggestions for optimising power in practice. As well as providing ﬁgures, tables and tools for estimating the power of caseecontrol comparisons, we hope to assist researchers in setting realistic expectations for what such tests can achieve in general.},

	abstract = {We tested a patient with visual agnosia who had suffered severe bilateral brain damage early in life, on a series of visuomotor tasks. The broad pattern of results confirms that S.B., like the extensively tested patient D.F., shows an impressive array of preserved skills, despite his severe perceptual problems. Also like D.F., S.B. shows certain subtle visuomotor difficulties that can be related to the idea that his partially intact occipito-parietal areas are unable to benefit from interactions with the apparently severely damaged occipito-temporal regions. Unlike D.F., however, he is able to make accurate discriminations of simple visual features, such as object width and orientation, albeit with very slow response times. We hypothesize that several factors such as the early onset of S.B.’s lesion and the long period since his brain lesion have allowed his brain to compensate to a degree what has been impossible in D.F., whose brain damage occurred in adulthood. This may include an element of ‘rewiring’ and self-monitoring of visuomotor processes that allow S.B. to achieve perceptual access to visual information processed in the dorsal stream: information that is normally only available for on-line visuomotor control.},
